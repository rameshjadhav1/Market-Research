<p>Sweet corn is a variety of maize cultivated primarily for human consumption due to its naturally high sugar content. Unlike field corn, which is harvested for grain, sweet corn is grown and consumed as a vegetable. This variety manages the conversion of sugar to starch within the corn kernel&rsquo;s endosperm, giving it a sweet taste. Since the maturation process transforms the sugar into starch, sweet corn is harvested and eaten while still tender, before the kernels become tough and starchy. It is commonly consumed fresh, frozen, or canned. Nutritionally, sweet corn seeds offer several health benefits. They are rich in fiber, which aids digestion, and contain important nutrients such as potassium, folate, pantothenic acid, and vitamin B6.</p>
